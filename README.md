Reverse-View Mamba–Transformer with Cross-View Adaptive Feature Fusion for LiDAR Place Recognition

## Overview

RMT-PR is a single-frame LiDAR-based place recognition framework designed to improve robustness under severe viewpoint changes, long-term appearance variations, and reverse driving scenarios.

The method explicitly models reverse-view representations and integrates a Mamba–Transformer hybrid encoder with adaptive feature fusion to enhance global descriptor learning for place recognition.
